# Day-One Python Program

## Overview
This project is made up of two Python scripts, `part1.py` and `part2.py`, that process input from a file and display the output on the console.

## How to Run

1. **Prepare the Input File**: Place your input data in a file named `input.txt` in the same directory as the scripts.

2. **Run Part 1**: Execute the `part1.py` script to process the input:
   ```bash
   python part1.py
   ```
3. **Run Part 2**: Run `part2.py` to complete the processing:
   ```bash
   python part2.py
   ```

## Output
The final output will be printed to the console.

## Example
After running both scripts, you will see the processed result displayed on the console.
